# PROBLEM STATEMENT

Given data points provided, develop Hierarchical Clustering(Agglomerative) using Single Link technique?

Learning Objective: Apply Single Link Hierarchical Clustering(Agglomerative) :

Hierarchical algorithms can be further divided into divisive algorithms and agglomerative algorithms. Divisive clustering begins with all data elements in one cluster, which is later successively divided into smaller ones. On the other hand, agglomerative clustering begins with single-element clusters and works by successively merging them into larger ones.

Part B: please develop Cluster Python  program and run single-link, Complete-link and average-link Clusters and upload code and screen captures. (10)
